## Applicant Reactions

Once an offer is made, the referee deter mines the potential retainer’s reaction by rolling 2d6 on the table below, modified as follows:

- **Charisma:** The roll is modified by the hiring character’s reaction modifier due to CHA.
- **Generosity:** The referee may apply a bonus or penalty, depending on the attractiveness of the deal (+1 or +2 for generous offers, –1 or –2 for poor offers).
- **Reputation:** A penalty of –1 or –2 may be applied, if the hiring PC has a bad reputation.
