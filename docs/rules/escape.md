## ESCAPE CHECK

`Roll 2d6` for escape:

| SITUATION | MIN ROLL REQUIRED |
| --- | --- |
| You don't know where you are. | **9** |
| You know where you are. | **7** |
| You have a clear and unhindered path of escape. | **5** |

**CHALLENGE ADJUSTMENT**: Adjust the chance of escape by `+/-1/2/3` by the challege presented at current location and level of the dungeon.

**SMALL COMPLEX**: If the characters are attempting to escape from a lair or other small complex, decrease the score needed by `-1` or `-2`.

**MAKING THE CHECK**: An escape check is made for each character separately. `2` is always a failure. On a failed escape check, consult the table below:

### Failed check table

`Roll 1d12.`

| Roll | Result |
| --- | --- |
| **1–2** | You have died. Roll the escape chart again to see if your comrades were able to retrieve your body. (Instead of retrieving your body, your comrades may choose to loot it and/or leave it.) If they did not, roll the escape chart again to see if your comrades know where your body is. If they do not, there is a 50% chance that your body has been utterly destroyed.
| **3** | You escape but have been injured. You suffer 1d4 x 1d8 points of damage.
| **4** | You escape but have been injured 1d12 and robbed of your equipment!
| **5** | You have been captured, imprisoned, petrified, or otherwise trapped and must be rescued! Roll the escape chart again to see if your comrades know where you are. If they do not, roll the escape chart again to see if your comrades have a clue of some sort.
| **6** | You have become lost and seen nevermore!
| **7** | You have lost 1d6 pieces of equipment. Determine randomly between slots and bags. If a bag is lost, all of its contents are lost with it.
| **8** | You escape but have been permanently altered (maimed, permanently polymorphed, replaced with a double, etc.).
| **9** | You have been transformed into a monster (undead, lycanthrope, mind controlled, etc.).
| **10** | You escape unharmed.
| **11** | You return with the memory of a great discovery!
| **12** | Opportunity for betrayal. You can choose to either reroll on this table or betray a comrade who would otherwise escape. If you choose to betray a comrade roll 1d6 — on a roll of 1–4, you escape and they must roll on this table; on a roll of 5–6, both you and your victim suffer the fate they roll.
