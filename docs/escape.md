## ESCAPE CHECK

`Roll 2d6.`

| SITUATION | MINIMUM ROLL REQUIRED |
| --- | --- |
| You don't know where you are. | **9** |
| You know where you are. | **7** |
| You have a clear and unhindered path of escape. | **5** |

**CHALLENGE ADJUSTMENT**: Adjust the chance of escape by +/- 10% multipled by the difference between the average CR of the local opposition and the level of the character. (For example, a 5th-level character facing CR 7 opponents would suffer a -20% adjustment on their chance of escape. In a classic dungeon scenario, you can make this adjustment using the dungeon level — a 5th-level character on the 3rd level of the dungeon would enjoy a +20% adjustment on their chance of escape, for example.)

**SMALL COMPLEX**: If the characters are attempting to escape from a lair or other small complex, increase the chance of success by 10% to 20%.

**MAKING THE CHECK**: An escape check is made for each character separately. There is always a minimum 2 is always a failure. On a failed escape check, consult the table below:

### Failed check table

`Roll 1d12.`

| Roll | Result |
| --- | --- |
| **1–2** | You have died. Roll the escape percentile again to see if your comrades were able to retrieve your body. (Instead of retrieving your body, your comrades may choose to loot it and/or leave it.) If they did not, roll the escape percentile again to see if your comrades know where your body is. If they do not, there is a 50% chance that your body has been utterly destroyed. |
|**12**|Opportunity for betrayal. You can choose to either reroll on this table or betray a comrade who would otherwise escape. If you choose to betray a comrade roll 1d6 -- on a roll of 1-4, you escape and they must roll on this table; on a roll of 5-6, both you and your victim suffer the fate they roll.|
