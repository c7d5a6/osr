**Retainers** are NPCs that have class levels and associated skills. They are mercenaries and sellswords that
will accompany the PCs during any reasonable dungeon-delving activities, including combat. They will not hire
on with parties whose average level is lower than their own.

**0-level** retainers have 1 hp, no talents and special abilities, and need 10 xp to level up.

**XP:** retainers need double the amount of xp to level up.

**Resentment:** `2d6` check with modifiers against retainer's resentment if the retainer is exposed to something particularly dangerous, and after each adventure. On failure, the retainer leaves and cannot be re-hired.

## Charisma of PC

Charisma score of the PC influences the maximum number of retainers and their initial resentment.

|       CHA | Max # of retainers | Retainer resentment |
| --------: | :----------------: | ------------------- |
|     **3** |         1          | 9                   |
|   **4–8** |         2          | 8                   |
|  **9–12** |         3          | 7                   |
| **13–17** |         4          | 6                   |
|    **18** |         5          | 5                   |

## Cost

Retainers will usually want a guaranteed fee (per day or per adventure) and a share of treasure recovered. Fee and Share affect resentment checks separately.

| Fee       | Share      | Check bonus |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 2 SP/day  | 1⁄4 Share  | -2          |
| 5 SP/day  | 1⁄3 Share  | -1          |
| 1 GP/day  | 1⁄2 Share  | 0           |
| 5 GP/day  | 2⁄3 Share  | +1          |
| 10 GP/day | Full share | +2          |

## Applicant Reactions

Once an offer is made, the referee determines the potential retainer’s reaction by rolling 2d6 on the table below, modified as follows:

- **Generosity:** the same modifier as for resentment.
- **Reputation:** A penalty of –1 or –2 may be applied if the hiring PC has a bad reputation.
