## Preparing and Scouting

If characters spend `1d4` days scouting a site, doing research, training for their next adventure, and/or any other preparatory activity, they gain a *Prepared Item*. *Prepared Item* is a special item with 0 cost and it takes 1 gear slot. At any time during adventure, it can permanently turn into any basic gear with cost 1 gp or less. Only player characters can use this item. It can be only one *Prepared Item* in inventory at a time. Item expires after one adventure.
